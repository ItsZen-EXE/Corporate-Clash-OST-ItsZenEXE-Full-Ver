## THIS WILL BE UPDATED TO CLASH VERSION 1.3 WHEN I GET THE TIME TO WORK ON IT! ALSO WHEN THE UPDATE IS OUT FINALLY. 

# Corporate Clash OST (ItsZenEXE Full Ver)

This is the Corporate Clash OST with almost all songs ripped directly from the game.
## That said, I do NOT claim ownership of ANY of these songs, and they are created by Disney and the Corporate Clash team, NOT ME.
I have personally gone through all the songs and ordered them in a way that makes sense for the soundtrack, and in order of when you would most likely hear said things.

Some songs have unique names (a large majority of which I came up with for fun), and have the purpose of the song after the title, however all are ordered correctly still in the full album. The Disk number for the songs also separates them somewhat, but not much past the main game.

# Future Updates

I will be updating this whenever I can as new songs come out for the game, or things get changed/updated. To update your files, simply redownload the project and merge the files, overwriting old ones.

# How To Download

On the main project link (https://github.com/ItsZen-EXE/Corporate-Clash-OST-ItsZenEXE-Full-Ver) click at near the top of the project where it says "Code," then click "Download Zip". You will download both the OST and this file that way.

# Track Order

The songs are ordered as such, and this corresponds with the disk number on each track as well:

### OST 01 - Main Game
1) Intro
2) Toontown Central & Toontown Central Miniboss
3) Barnacle Boatyard & Barnacle Boatyard Miniboss
4) Ye Olde Toontown & Ye Olde Toontown Miniboss
5) Daffodil Gardens
6) Sellbot Suite
7) Mezzo Melodyland
8) Cashbot Suite
9) The Brrrgh
10) Lawbot Suite
11) Acorn Acres
12) Bossbot Suite
13) Drowsy Dreamland
14) Boardbot Suite
15) Minigames
### 16) OST 02 - Various Events (April Toons, Halloween, Christmas, etc.)
### 17) OST 03 - Extras (Unused / Removed / Bonus songs)

# A Note About Certain songs
Some songs are here all the way from Toontown Online by Disney, and as such have been marked with a * at the start of the actual title of the songs. For Example, "High Price (*Sellbot Hq: Battle)" is from TTO, and thus it has a mark at the start of the actual title for said song.

Some songs are also added to the end in OST 03 that are removed from the game at this point.
