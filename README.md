# Corporate Clash OST (ItsZenEXE Full Ver)

This is the Corporate Clash OST with almost all songs ripped directly from the game. That said, I do NOT

I have personally gone through all the songs and ordered them in a way that makes sense for the soundtrack, and in order of when you would most likely hear said things.

Some songs have unique names, and have the purpose of the song after the title, however all are ordered correctly still in the full album.

The Disk number for the songs also separates them somewhat, but not past the main game.

# Track Order

The songs are ordered as such, and this corresponds with the disk number on each track as well:

OST 01 - Main Game
1) Intro
2) Toontown Central & Toontown Central Miniboss
3) Barnacle Boatyard & Barnacle Boatyard Miniboss
4) Ye Olde Toontown & Ye Olde Toontown Miniboss
5) Daffodil Gardens
6) Sellbot Suite
7) Mezzo Melodyland
8) Cashbot Suite
9) The Brrrgh
10) Lawbot Suite
11) Acorn Acres
12) Bossbot Suite
13) Drowsy Dreamland
14) Boardbot Suite
15) Minigames

16) OST 02 - Various Events (April Toons, Halloween, Christmas, etc.)

17) OST 03 - Extras (Unused / Removed / Bonus songs)

# A Note About Certain songs
Some songs are here all the way from Toontown Online by Disney, and as such have been marked with a * at the start of the actual title of the songs. For Example, "High Price (*Sellbot Hq: Battle)" is from TTO, and thus have a mark at the start of the actual title for said song.
